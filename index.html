    <h1><strong>WHY TO BOYCOTT ISRAELI PRODUCTS?</strong></h1>
    <p>
         <b>Boycotting Israeli products</b> is a form of protest that seeks to apply economic pressure 
        on Israel to address and change its policies towards Palestinians, particularly those that have been criticized 
        internationally. Supporters of the boycott believe it is a non-violent means to advocate for Palestinian 
        rights and to push for an end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories. Critics of Israel argue that its settlements 
        and military actions violate international law and human rights. Thus, the boycott aims to promote 
        accountability and peace by financially influencing Israel's economic landscape.

        <p>
            Israel has been opressing Palestinians since many years but the recent genocide since <dfn>7<sup>th</sup> October 2023</dfn>
            is the next level of cruelty. The call to <b>boycott Israeli products</b> is rooted primarily in political activism, 
            particularly in response to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Supporters of the boycott argue 
            that it is a form of non-violent protest aimed at pressuring Israel to change its policies towards Palestinians, 
            particularly those that are perceived as unjust or violating human. <br>
            One of the main reasons cited for the boycott is the desire to oppose the settlement expansion in the West Bank,
            which is considered <b>illegal</b> under international law, but Israeli is commiting the war crimes as 
            per <abbr title="United Nations">UN</abbr>. These settlements are often seen as a barrier to peace because they are built 
            on land that Palestinians view as part of their future state. 
            By boycotting products made in these areas, activists aim to reduce the economic viability of the settlements.
            Furthermore, advocates of the boycott believe that international consumer pressure can serve as a catalyst for
             political change. This is modeled after similar historical boycotts, like the boycott of South African goods 
             during apartheid, which played a role in ending the regime. They argue that economic pressure can lead to 
             meaningful discussions about human rights and potentially lead to a change in policy.
            Critics of the boycott, however, argue that it can deepen divisions and hurt the very people it intends to help 
            by damaging the economy and potentially leading to job losses among both Palestinians and Israelis. They also 
            claim that it can stifle dialogue and prolong the conflict by hardening attitudes on both sides. <em>The decision to 
            participate in such a boycott is deeply personal and can reflect an individual's stance on human rights, international 
            law, and peacebuilding efforts. Whether one supports or opposes the boycott, it remains a contentious issue in 
            international politics and a vivid example of how global consumers can be engaged in acts of political significance.</em><br>
